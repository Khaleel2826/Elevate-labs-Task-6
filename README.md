# Password Strength Evaluation
## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to understand how password complexity impacts security by creating and evaluating passwords of varying strength levels (Weak, Medium, Strong).

## 🛠 Tool Used
- [PasswordMonster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/) – Free online password strength checker
- Microsoft Excel – to document password samples and their strength
- Python – to generate a random set of passwords

## 📄 Deliverables
- ✅ 100 randomly generated passwords
- ✅ Passwords labeled as *Weak, **Medium, or **Strong*
- ✅ Password Strength Report: [Password_Strength_Report.docx](Password_Strength_Report.docx)

## 🗂 Files Uploaded
- Password_Strength_Report.docx
- Screen Shots of some passwords while checking there strength in [PasswordMonster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)
  
## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered
- *Password Strength Evaluation*
- *Best Practices for Strong Passwords*
- *Common Password Attacks*
  - Brute-force attack
  - Dictionary attack
- *Password Creation Techniques*
  - Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
  - Use of long and unpredictable combinations

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Passwords with predictable patterns (e.g., 123456, nithya123) are weak and easily cracked.
- Adding symbols, numbers, and mixed-case letters increases password strength.
- Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long with complexity.
- PasswordMonster helped understand how long different passwords would take to crack.
- Password managers and multi-factor authentication greatly enhance security.
